// Side scroll through the `all-characters` ul and click on a character.
// When they select a character, the `main` should appear and information about that
// character (name, image, status, location name) should populate in the `character-info` section.
// When they click on a different character, this information should be replaced.
// The page `title` should also match the name of the character selected. 
// Use the `form`, to submit a character comment. Each comment should be a new `li` inside of `character-comments-ul`,
// with the selected character's name (in bold) and a comment (not bold).
